# Projects Folder

This folder is used to store user project files created through the CodingApp.

## Purpose

- **User Projects**: Contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files created by users
- **Project Organization**: Helps organize and manage user-created content
- **Backup Storage**: Provides a backup location for user projects

## Structure

The folder structure will be created automatically when users save projects:

```
projects/
├── user1/
│   ├── project1/
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   ├── styles.css
│   │   └── script.js
│   └── project2/
│       └── ...
└── user2/
    └── ...
```

## Notes

- This folder is tracked by Git to ensure the directory structure exists
- The `.gitkeep` file ensures the folder is included in version control
- User project files will be stored here when the application is running
